 - Added `nb` (Norwegian Bokmål) and `nn` (Norwegian Nynorsk) as aliases for
   `no` (Norwegian) [issue #3]
 - Removed attribute chaining, which was accidentally released in v0.04 but was
   previously decided against [issue #6]
 - Required Lingua::Stem::UniNE v0.08, containing a workaround for
   Perl v5.13.10–v5.16.0 bug RT#113750 which caused the `fa` (Persian) stemmer
   to clobber `$_` due to its use of the `charnames` pragma which uses the
   previously buggy `re` pragma [issue #7]

   exceptions per language
